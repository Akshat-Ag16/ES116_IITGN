# Integrated Ultrasonic-Based Occupancy Detection System

This project is a smart room occupancy monitoring system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect presence and triggers real-time alerts. It includes multimodal alerts (buzzer + LCD display) and Bluetooth-based remote monitoring capabilities. It was built using a State-Machine Algorithm that detects movement in 3 stages
